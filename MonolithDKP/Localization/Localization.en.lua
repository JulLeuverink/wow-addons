A full broadcast does NOT merge tables. It completely overwrites everyone in the guild's table with exact copies of yours. It is also recommended that you /reload your UI after each dkp/loot session to commit the data to your SavedVariables file. If you go an entire raid without reloading and then crash or disconnect at the end, all data that had been applied will be lost. Reloading after each boss can help prevent this. Additionally, editing tables (awarding DKP or deleting entries to test the addon) while other officers are offline WILL cause them to have out of date tables, despite having the exact same data.
